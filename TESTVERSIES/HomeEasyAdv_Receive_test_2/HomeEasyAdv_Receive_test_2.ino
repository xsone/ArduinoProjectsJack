/*
 * AM-HRR3 receiver test
 *
 * Homeeasy protocol receiver for the new protocol.
 *
 * This protocol isn't documented so well, so here goes (this is largely from memory).
 *
 * The data is encoded on the wire (aerial) as a Manchester code.
 *
 * A latch of 275us high, 2675us low is sent before the data.
 * There is a gap of 10ms between each message.
 *
 * 0 = holding the line high for 275us then low for 275us.
 * 1 = holding the line high for 275us then low for 1225us.
 *
 * The timings seem to vary quite noticeably between devices.  HE300 devices have a
 * low for about 1300us for a 1 whereas HE303 devices seem to have a low of about
 * 1100us.  If this script does not detect your signals try relaxing the timing
 * conditions.
 *
 * Each actual bit of data is encoded as two bits on the wire as:
 * Data 0 = Wire 01
 * Data 1 = Wire 10
 *
 * The actual message is 32 bits of data (64 wire bits):
 * bits 0-25: the group code - a 26bit number assigned to controllers.
 * bit 26: group flag
 * bit 27: on/off flag
 * bits 28-31: the device code - a 4bit number.
 *
 * The group flag just seems to be a separate set of addresses you can program devices
 * to and doesn't trigger the dim cycle when sending two ONs.
 *
 * There's extra support for setting devices to a specific dim-level that you get
 * with the HE100 ultimate remote control. I think this involves sending a Wire 11 at
 * the on/off flag position and then the message is longer with another 4 bits for dim
 * level.
 * Need to look into this.
