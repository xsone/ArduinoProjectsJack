/*
  Blink
 
 Turns on an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.
 
 The circuit:
 * LED connected from digital pin 13 to ground.
 
 * Note: On most Arduino boards, there is already an LED on the board
 connected to pin 13, so you don't need any extra components for this example.
